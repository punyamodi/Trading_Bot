# MLTrader Strategy

This repository contains Python code for a trading strategy called MLTrader implemented using the Lumibot framework. The MLTrader strategy utilizes machine learning sentiment analysis to make trading decisions.

## Overview

The MLTrader strategy works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The strategy is initialized with parameters such as the trading symbol and the percentage of cash at risk per trade.

2. **Position Sizing**: Calculates the quantity of shares to trade based on the available cash and the current price of the trading symbol.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Retrieves news articles related to the trading symbol for the last three days and estimates sentiment using a machine learning model.

4. **Trading Decision**: Based on the sentiment analysis, if the sentiment is positive and the probability exceeds a threshold, a buy order is placed with a bracket order for take profit and stop loss. If the sentiment is negative and the probability exceeds a threshold, a sell order is placed with a bracket order.

5. **Backtesting**: The strategy is backtested using historical data from Yahoo Finance to evaluate its performance over a specified time period.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Lumibot framework
- alpaca_trade_api
- timedelta
- finbert_utils (for sentiment analysis)

## Usage

To run the backtest for the MLTrader strategy, execute the following command:

```bash
python mltrader_backtest.py
```

Ensure that you have provided valid API credentials for the Alpaca broker and configured the required parameters such as the trading symbol and cash at risk.

## Configuration

You can customize the MLTrader strategy by adjusting parameters such as the trading symbol, cash at risk, and sentiment analysis thresholds in the `MLTrader` class.
